group-permission: |
  Groups may have a group permission node automatically assigned to their
  members. This is the name of that permission node. It must be a string
  suitable for Java's String.format() with one argument: the group name.
  Omit or leave blank ('') to disable this feature.
  This may also be a list of strings to automatically assign multiple
  permissions.

assigned-group-permission: |
  Similar to group-permission, but only applied to "assigned" groups (groups
  that the player is explicitly a member of, including the default group, but
  not any inherited groups).
  Omit or leave blank ('') to disable this feature.
  This may also be a list of strings to automatically assign multiple
  permissions.

assigned-groups-can-include-default: |
  Set to false if you want your assigned-group-permission (above) to never
  include the default group.

default-group: |
  The default group. Players that are not explicitly members of any group
  are placed in this group.

default-track: |
  The default track. When the track name is omitted while using the /promote,
  /demote, /setrank, and /unsetrank commands, this is the track used.

dump-directory: |
  Directory (relative to the server root) where to load/store dumps.

default-temp-permission-timeout: |
  Default timeout for temporary permissions, in seconds

tracks: |
  Track definitions. Each key should be the name of the track. The value
  should be a list of group names in ascending order.

cache-max-idle: |
  Max idle in seconds for entries in the database cache. Set to 0 or negative
  to use Avaje's global setting from ebean.properties.
  (If ebean.properties doesn't exist, the default is 600.)
  NOTE: /permissions reload does not update this value

cache-max-ttl: |
  Max time-to-live in seconds for entries in the database cache. Set to 0 or
  negative to use Avaje's global setting from ebean.properties.
  (If ebean.properties doesn't exist, the default is 21600 or 6 hours.)
  NOTE: /permissions reload does not update this value

cache-size: |
  Maximum size of database cache. Set to 0 or negative to use Avaje's global
  setting from ebean.properties.
  (If ebean.properties doesn't exist, the default is 1000.)
  NOTE: /permissions reload does not update this value

kick-on-error: |
  If any problems occur while determining a player's permissions (e.g.
  SQLExceptions, network errors, etc.), kick the player. This may be more
  desirable to having the user have free reign with indeterminate permissions.

kick-ops-on-error: |
  Only valid if kick-on-error is true. If a problem occurs while determining
  an op's permissions, then the op will only be kicked if this is true.

region-support: |
  Whether region-based permissions are enabled. Requires WorldGuard. Setting
  this to false will save some processing if you use WorldGuard but don't use
  region-based permissions. Has no effect if WorldGuard is not present.

debug: |
  Enable debug logging.
